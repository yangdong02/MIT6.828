# MIT 6.S081: Operating System Engineering

I'm following the 2020 Fall version of [MIT 6.S081 Operating System Engineering](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/schedule.html) (formerly known as 6.828).

The lab is about implementing new features on xv6, an educational operating system. Xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

Each new feature corresponds to a branch.

## Setting up the environment

See https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/tools.html

## Tests

The course staff in 6.S081 has developped a wide range of tests for each lab. Please refer to the lab webpage for how to run tests.

## Progress

Refer to corresponding branches for codes and commits. Except for lab lock where integrated tests sometimes fails, the tests in all other labs are passed.
